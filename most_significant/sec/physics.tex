\section{Goal (3): State Sum descriptions of Topological Quantum Field Theories}

The significance of topology in the field of condensed matter physics is epitomized by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded for ``theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter." There are primarily two approaches for defining topological quantum field theories (TQFTs): the first relies on higher categories, manifolds, and functors, while the second centres on lattices and state sums. The exact interrelation between these two methods remains a subject of keen interest in the mathematical physics community. In the research conducted by A. Kapustin and colleagues mentioned earlier, Steenrod cup-i products played a vital role in their state sum formulations.
